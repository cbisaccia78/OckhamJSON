# Ockham JSON

# Purpose: 
    A C Libary for the Serialization/De-Serialization of JSON text data

# A Brief Introduction to JSON (From [RFC-8259](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259)):
    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the
    serialization of structured data.  It is derived from the object
    literals of JavaScript, as defined in the ECMAScript Programming
    Language Standard, Third Edition [ECMA-262].

    JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans,
    and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays).

    A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters [UNICODE].
    Note that this citation references the latest version of Unicode
    rather than a specific release.  It is not expected that future
    changes in the Unicode specification will impact the syntax of JSON.

    An object is an unordered collection of zero or more name/value
    pairs, where a name is a string and a value is a string, number,
    boolean, null, object, or array.

    An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more values.

    The terms "object" and "array" come from the conventions of
    JavaScript.

    JSON's design goals were for it to be minimal, portable, textual, and
    a subset of JavaScript.

    Future Changes:
        ECMA and IETF will work together to reconcile any differences between
        RFC8259 and [ECMA-404].
